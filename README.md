# Trackitime
How	many	hours	did	you	use	with	your	practice	work?	Or	with	your	origami	
project?	Trackitime	is	an application	 to	solve	 this	problem.	With	Trackitime	one	can	easily	create	a	new	project,	and	add	time	periods	spent	with	the	project.
Later	some	statistics	can	be	seen	of	the	project:	what	have	been	done,	how	much	time	have	been	spent	altogether	and	so	on.
Trackitime	is	used	with	an	easily-used web application,	which	is	also	supportive for	mobile	browsers. The	users	are	identified	with	a	logging	system	and	personal	accounts.

Trackitime is my university's database/web-app practice work (University of Helsinki).
